1. lpkg does not use compresion.
2. as it does not have "real" implementation of MNP protocol, it could hang
   when it should retransmit frame.
3. remember, that standard Newton's speed is 38400 bps. If you want to use
   115200bps, install FastSerialConnection.pkg on your Newton. Don't forget
   selecting FastSerial intead of Serial in connection dialog !
